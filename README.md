 Helper tool for making engine modules in Godot (4)

This is a little thingamabob I made in an evening to automate all the set, get, and bind functions needed to register variables in Godot C++ modules.

I'm also working on adding a very rough GDScript to C++ translator for transfering GDScript prototypes to C++.

I've tried to make the UI self explanatory, and **use this tool at your (code's) own risk**. The GDScript to C++ converter in particular is gonna give rough results, not miraculous usable ones.
